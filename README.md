# Breast-Cancer-Detection

#### Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

#### This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in the field of medical diagnostics.

#### The primary objective was to create a predictive model that could accurately classify tumors as Malignant or Benign based on a range of various factors taken from the 'Fine Needle Biopsy' procedure.

#### Using essential libraries like pandas and numpy, the initial dataset exploration was done on the Breast Cancer dataset. The primary objective was to create a predictive model that could accurately classify tumors as Malignant or Benign based on a range of various factors taken from the 'Fine Needle Biopsy' procedure.

#### Preprocessed the Breast Cancer dataset, ensuring the data was clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis.

#### Implemented the Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn. This choice was motivated by the nature of the problem - binary classification - and Logistic Regression's suitability for such tasks.

#### With the model architecture in place, I conducted rigorous training using the training dataset. The model effectively learned intricate patterns from the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions when presented with unseen data during testing.

#### Gauged its accuracy and assessed its ability to discern between Malignant and Benign tumors. 

#### The dataset can be directly imported from the sklearn library or can be loaded into the pandas dataframe externally. I have directly imported it.
